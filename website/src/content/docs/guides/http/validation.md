title: Validation
description: Pydantic-style pipeline, field constraints, hooks, Dump, and the 422 problem document.
---

siderite validation is modelled on Pydantic v2, built from Rust traits and
derives rather than runtime type inspection.

```rust
use siderite::prelude::*;

#[derive(Deserialize, Validate, Schema)]
#[serde(rename_all = "camelCase")]
#[model_config(extra = "forbid", str_strip_whitespace)]
struct CreateUser {
    #[field(min_length = 2, max_length = 50)]
    user_name: String,
    #[field(email)]
    email: String,
    #[field(ge = 13)]
    age: Option<u8>,
}
```

`Json<CreateUser>` as a handler argument runs the whole pipeline. When the
input is invalid, the handler is not called. The client gets a **422**
problem document that lists every error, not just the first:

```json
{
  "type": "about:blank",
  "title": "Unprocessable Entity",
  "status": 422,
  "detail": "The request could not be processed; see `errors` for details.",
  "errors": [
    {"location": ["body", "userName"], "code": "too_short", "message": "should have at least 2 items/characters"},
    {"location": ["body", "email"], "code": "invalid_email", "message": "invalid email address"},
    {"location": ["body", "role"], "code": "extra_forbidden", "message": "extra inputs are not permitted"}
  ]
}
```

Error locations use the key the client actually sent (an alias if one was
used). Codes follow Pydantic names where one exists (`int_parsing`,
`missing`, `extra_forbidden`).

## Pipeline

1. **Model before-validators** on the raw JSON / query / form value.
2. **Field walk** — aliases, missing keys, extra keys.
3. **Field before-validators**, then **type-driven `prepare`**: each type
   checks, and in lax mode coerces, its own part of the input (integers
   accept `"42"` and `3.0`; `bool` accepts `"yes"`, `"on"`, `1`; strings
   apply the model’s trim and case settings; constrained types check
   bounds). Coercion works through newtypes and aliases. All errors are
   collected before anything is deserialized.
4. **Field constraints** on the raw value (`min_length`, `ge`, …).
5. **Serde deserialize**. A property test checks that when `prepare`
   accepts an input, Serde accepts it too.
6. **Field after-validators**, then **model after-validators**.

Query strings, forms, and path segments count as *text input*:
string-to-number coercion is always allowed for them, even in strict mode.
A key that is repeated in a query string fills a `Vec` field.

## `#[model_config(...)]`

| Key | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `strict` | No lax coercion: `"1"` is not an integer, and `1` is not a bool |
| `extra = "ignore" \| "forbid" \| "allow"` | Unknown keys. Rust structs cannot store extras, so `allow` accepts them and then drops them. `#[serde(deny_unknown_fields)]` implies `forbid`, and `forbid` sets `additionalProperties: false` |
| `populate_by_name` | For aliased fields, the Rust field name is also accepted |
| `str_strip_whitespace`, `str_to_lower`, `str_to_upper` | Applied to every string field of this model |
| `hooks` | Required on **generic** models that have `#[model_hooks]` |

Settings apply only to the model they are declared on. Nested models use
their own settings.

## `#[field(...)]` validation keys

The same attribute is read by `Validate` and `Schema`, so the constraints
you check are the constraints that get documented. Key names always come
from Serde (`rename`, `rename_all`).

| Key | Validation | Schema |
|---|---|---|
| `min_length`, `max_length` | Characters in a string, or items in a list or map | `minLength` / `maxLength`, or `minItems` / `maxItems` |
| `pattern = "regex"` | Whole-value match. The regex is checked when the macro expands | `pattern` |
| `email` | Email format | `format: email` |
| `gt`, `ge`, `lt`, `le` | Numeric bounds | `exclusiveMinimum`, `minimum`, `exclusiveMaximum`, `maximum` |
| `multiple_of` | Divisibility | `multipleOf` |
| `validation_alias = "x"` | Extra accepted input key | — |
| `default = expr`, `default_factory = path` | Field becomes optional; Serde must also default it | Left out of `required` |
| `strict` | Strict mode for this field only | — |
| `exclude` | Left out of `dump` output | — |
| `validator = path` | Reusable after-validator, `fn(&T) -> Result<(), FieldError>` | — |
| `title`, `description`, `examples(...)` | — | Annotations |

The combined Validate + Model + Schema key list is in
[Field attributes](/siderite/reference/field-attributes/).

## Hooks

```rust
#[model_hooks]
impl CreateUser {
    #[field_validator("user_name", mode = "after")]
    fn not_reserved(value: &str) -> Result<(), FieldError> {
        if value == "admin" {
            Err(FieldError::new("reserved", "name is reserved"))
        } else {
            Ok(())
        }
    }

    #[model_validator(mode = "after")]
    fn adult_email(&self) -> Result<(), FieldError> { Ok(()) }

    #[computed_field]
    fn display_name(&self) -> String { format!("@{}", self.user_name) }
}
```

Order:

1. Model before-validators.
2. For each field, in declaration order: before-validators, type `prepare`,
   constraints.
3. Serde deserialization.
4. Field after-validators, in declaration order.
5. Model after-validators.

The derives find `#[model_hooks]` on concrete types without being told. A
**generic** model such as `Page<T>` with hooks must declare
`#[model_config(hooks)]`. Field validators and serializers take
`(value: &FieldTy)`. A reusable `#[field(validator = path)]` runs right
after the field’s own checks, before the `#[model_hooks]` validators.

## Serialization: `Dump`

`Json<T>` responses serialize through `Dump`, not directly with Serde.

- `#[derive(Schema)]` implements `Dump` for any type that also derives
  `Serialize`. Input-only types still compile. `#[schema(no_dump)]` opts
  out.
- Computed fields, field serializers, and model serializers are included,
  including those of nested models inside `Vec`, `Option`, or maps.
- `JsonDump(value, DumpOptions::new().exclude_none())` controls output per
  response. Options: `exclude_none`, `exclude_defaults`,
  `include(FieldSet)`, `exclude(FieldSet)`.
- A hand-written type opts in with `impl Dump for T {}`, which uses plain
  Serde output.

Computed fields appear in OpenAPI as `readOnly` properties.

`exclude_unset` is not available: Serde does not record which fields were
explicitly set.

## Constrained types

| Type | Accepts |
|---|---|
| `ConstrainedString<MIN, MAX>` | String with MIN..=MAX characters |
| `Email` | Email-format string |
| `SecretString` | Redacted in `Debug`, `Display`, and serialized output |
| `BoundedI64<MIN, MAX>` | Integer in MIN..=MAX |
| `PositiveInt`, `NonNegativeInt`, `NegativeInt` | `> 0`, `>= 0`, `< 0` |
| `Url`, `HttpUrl` | `url` crate; `HttpUrl` only `http` / `https` |
| `IpAddress`, `Ipv4Address`, `Ipv6Address` | IP address strings |
| `Uuid` | Hyphenated or simple UUID, any version |
| `Decimal<MAX_DIGITS, DECIMAL_PLACES>` | Exact decimals. Strict mode accepts only strings |
| `BoundedFloat<B: FloatBounds>` | Finite floats (`UnitInterval`, `NonNegative`, `Positive`, or your own) |
| `ConstrainedVec<T, MIN, MAX>` | List with MIN..=MAX items |

`#[field(max_digits, decimal_places)]` on a plain field only documents the
limits (as `x-` schema extensions). Use the `Decimal` type to enforce them.

## Hand-written implementations

`impl Validate for T {}` opts a type in without checks. For text input
(query strings, forms), implement `prepare` as well; without it,
`?flag=true` remains a string. `siderite::validation::model::{prepare_object,
FieldSpec, check}` are the building blocks the derive uses.
