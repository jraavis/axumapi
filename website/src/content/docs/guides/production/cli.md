title: CLI
description: AppCli versus the standalone siderite binary, commands, flags, check, and dbshell.
---

Install the CLI, then use it instead of typing `cargo run -- …`:

```bash
cargo install --path crates/siderite-cli
siderite new myapp
cd myapp
siderite run
```

`new` writes an API crate. In a Cargo package, `run`, `routes`, `check`,
`dbshell`, `makemigrations` and the other migration commands invoke
`cargo run -- <command>` so `AppCli` in your binary sees the app. `test`
is `cargo test`. Without a package, `migrate` / `rollback` /
`showmigrations` / `squashmigrations` run against JSON files.

| | `siderite` in a package | Standalone (no package) | `AppCli` in your binary |
|---|---|---|---|
| Needs your `App` and models | compiles them via cargo | no | yes |
| Commands | `new`, `run`, `routes`, `check`, `dbshell`, migrations, `test` | `migrate`, `rollback`, `showmigrations`, `squashmigrations` | `run`, `routes`, `check`, `dbshell`, migrations |

Exit codes: `0` success, `1` failure (or `check` found an error), `2` usage
error.

## Standalone binary

```bash
cargo install --path crates/siderite-cli --features postgres,mysql
siderite migrate --database-url postgres://app@localhost/app
siderite showmigrations --migrations-dir db/migrations
```

SQLite is always compiled in. PostgreSQL and MySQL are opt-in cargo
features of `siderite-cli`: `postgres` and `mysql`. The backend is picked by
URL scheme (`sqlite:`, `postgres://`, `mysql://`); a URL for a backend that
was not compiled in is an error. Error messages never contain the URL.
`squashmigrations` only reads and writes files, so it works without a
database URL.

## `AppCli`

```rust
use siderite_cli::{AppCli, CliSettings};
use siderite::prelude::*;

#[tokio::main]
async fn main() -> std::process::ExitCode {
    AppCli::new(build_app)
        .models(&[User::META, Post::META])
        .settings(
            CliSettings::new()
                .addr("0.0.0.0:8000")
                .database("default", "postgres://app@localhost/app"),
        )
        .migrations_dir("migrations")
        .run()
        .await
}
```

`AppCli::new` takes a factory: `check` builds the app more than once.
`CliSettings` holds the listen address and database URLs by alias. Build it
from loaded configuration with `CliSettings::from(&siderite::config::load()?)`,
which takes `server.addr` and every `databases.<alias>.url`. Its `Debug`
output lists aliases only. `AppCli::run_from(args)` takes explicit
arguments, which is handy in tests.

`run` connects every SQL alias and registers them as the app’s
`Databases`. Two hooks shape that registry:

```rust
AppCli::new(build_app)
    .configure_db(|_alias, db| db.with_signals(receivers::signals()))
    .database_router(AppRouter)
```

`configure_db` runs once per connected alias, before registration.
`database_router` installs a [DatabaseRouter](/siderite/guides/data/database-routing/).

## Commands

| Command | What it does |
|---|---|
| `run [--addr ADDR]` | Connects every configured SQL database, registers each under its alias, and serves the app. Redis and MongoDB aliases are skipped: register those yourself in the factory |
| `routes` | Prints `METHOD PATH operation_id` for every route, mounts included |
| `check` | Validates configuration, models, migrations, routes, and the backend. Exits `1` when an error is found |
| `dbshell` | Starts the database’s native client |
| `makemigrations [--name SLUG] [--empty] [--dry-run]` | Diffs compiled models against the graph and writes a JSON migration. Never connects to a database |
| `migrate [TARGET] [--dry-run]` | Applies migrations |
| `rollback [--steps N \| TARGET] [--dry-run]` | Unapplies migrations |
| `showmigrations` | `[X]` applied / `[ ]` pending |
| `squashmigrations FROM TO [--name SLUG]` | Collapses a range. Never connects to a database |

See [Migrations](/siderite/guides/data/migrations/) for the file format and
reversibility.

### Global flags

| Flag | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `--database ALIAS` | Alias used by `migrate`, `rollback`, `showmigrations`, and `dbshell` (default `default`) |
| `--database-url URL` | Database URL, overriding the settings |
| `--migrations-dir DIR` | Directory of JSON migrations (default `migrations`) |
| `--addr ADDR` | Listen address for `run` |
| `--help`, `-h` | Help |

Flags may appear anywhere and take `--flag value` or `--flag=value`.

### Precedence

**Listen address** (`run`): `--addr`, then the `ADDR` environment
variable, then `CliSettings::addr`, then `127.0.0.1:8000`. Empty values
count as unset.

**Database** (`migrate`, `rollback`, `showmigrations`, `dbshell`):
`--database-url`, then the URL configured for the selected alias, then,
for the `default` alias only, `DATABASE_URL`. With none of those, the
command fails with a “no database” error naming the alias.

## `check`

`check` runs without starting a server or opening a database. Each issue
prints as `error: [models.E003] message` or `warning: [id] message`.
Messages never contain database URLs.

| Id | Level | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `config.E001` | error | models are registered but no `default` database is configured |
| `config.E002` | error | a database URL has no scheme or does not parse |
| `config.E003` | error | a database URL uses an unsupported scheme |
| `models.E001` | error | two models use the same table |
| `models.E002` | error | a model name is registered more than once |
| `models.E003` | error | a model has no primary key |
| `models.E004` | error | a foreign key points to a model that is not registered |
| `models.E005` | error | a many-to-many relation (or its through model) targets an unregistered model |
| `models.E006` | error | two fields map to the same column |
| `models.E007` | error | a model has more than one primary-key field |
| `migrations.E001` | error | the migration files cannot be loaded |
| `migrations.E002` | error | the migration dependency graph is invalid |
| `migrations.E003` | error | the migrations do not replay cleanly |
| `migrations.W001` | warning | model changes are not recorded in any migration; run `makemigrations` |
| `openapi.E001` | error | the OpenAPI document cannot be generated |
| `routes.E001` | error | the app cannot be built into a router |
| `backend.E001` | error | the `default` database is Redis, which cannot hold models |
| `backend.E002` | error | a model needs joins the `default` backend does not support |
| `backend.E003` | error | the schema cannot be created on the `default` backend |
| `backend.W001` | warning | the backend has no schema migrations; `migrate` will refuse to run |

Migration checks are skipped when no migrations directory is passed to
`siderite_cli::check`; `AppCli` always passes its own.

## `dbshell`

`dbshell` starts `sqlite3`, `psql`, or `mysql` on the selected database and
returns the client’s exit code. Passwords never appear on the command line
or in output: `psql` receives `PGPASSWORD` and `mysql` receives `MYSQL_PWD`
in its environment. A userinfo password and a PostgreSQL `?password=` query
parameter both move into `PGPASSWORD` and are stripped from the URL passed
to `psql`. A URL that carries `sslpassword` is refused. For MySQL only
host, port, user, and database are forwarded. An in-memory SQLite URL, an
unknown scheme, or a client that is not on `PATH` is an error. MongoDB and
Redis are not supported.
