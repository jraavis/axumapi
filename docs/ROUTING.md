# Routing

siderite routes are plain values. A path plus a `MethodRouter` makes a `Route`;
an `App` collects routes, mounts other apps and generates the OpenAPI 3.1
document from the same values, so docs cannot drift from the code.

## Function API

```rust
use siderite::prelude::*;

let app = App::new()
    .title("Users")
    .version("1.0.0")
    .route(
        "/users",
        post(create_user).status(StatusCode::CREATED).tag("users")
            .get(list_users).summary("List users"),
    );
```

* `get`, `post`, `put`, `patch`, `delete`, `head`, `options` create a
  `MethodRouter` and can be chained (`.get(..).post(..)`); `.on(Method, h)`
  takes any method.
* Metadata builders `.summary() .description() .tag() .operation_id()
  .deprecated() .hidden() .status(StatusCode) .response_model::<T>()` apply to
  the **most recently added** method, so order matters.
* `App::routes(iter)` accepts `Route`s (`Route::new(path, router)`), which is
  what the macros below produce.
* Path templates use `{name}` parameters (`{*rest}` for a catch-all). Duplicate
  `(path, method)` pairs and paths without a leading `/` are rejected when
  the app is built.

## Route macros

`#[get]`, `#[post]`, `#[put]`, `#[patch]`, `#[delete]`, `#[head]`,
`#[options]` and `#[ws]` (a `GET`) attach a route to an `async fn`.

```rust
/// Create a user.
///
/// Stores the user and returns it.
#[post("/users", status = 201, response_model = UserOut, tag = "users",
       tags("a", "b"), summary = "..", description = "..",
       operation_id = "..", deprecated, hidden)]
async fn create_user(Json(input): Json<UserIn>) -> Json<UserOut> { /* .. */ }
```

The first argument is the path (a string literal). All other arguments are
optional and may appear in any order; each may appear once (`tag` and `tags`
are separate keys and are combined).

### Exact expansion

The function is left untouched (it stays callable). Next to it, with the same
visibility, the macro emits:

```rust
#[doc(hidden)]
#[allow(non_snake_case, dead_code)]
fn __siderite_route_create_user() -> ::siderite::Route {
    ::siderite::Route::new(
        "/users",
        ::siderite::post(create_user)
            .operation_id("create_user")
            .summary("Create a user.")
            .description("Stores the user and returns it.")
            .tag("users").tag("a").tag("b")
            .status(::siderite::http::StatusCode::from_u16(201)
                .unwrap_or(::siderite::http::StatusCode::OK))
            .response_model::<UserOut>(),
    )
}
```

`deprecated` and `hidden` add `.deprecated()` / `.hidden()`. `#[ws]` uses
`::siderite::get`. The `unwrap_or` fallback is unreachable: the status is
validated at compile time.

### Metadata semantics

* `operation_id` defaults to the function name.
* `summary` defaults to the first line of the doc comment; `description`
  defaults to the remaining lines (each trimmed, joined with `\n`, omitted
  when empty). Explicit arguments replace the doc-derived value.
* `status` (100..=599) replaces a `200 OK` returned by the handler at runtime
  and moves the documented success response to that code. Handlers returning
  another status (e.g. `WithStatus`) are not altered.
* `response_model = T` documents the success body as `T` (`application/json`)
  regardless of the return type; it does not convert the response.
* `hidden` serves the route but omits it from the OpenAPI document.

### Compile-time diagnostics

Reported with spans on the offending token: path not a string literal or not
starting with `/`, unbalanced braces, invalid or duplicate `{param}` names,
unknown or duplicate arguments, status outside 100..=599, non-`async` or
generic handlers, and route attributes on items other than functions.

## `routes![]`

```rust
App::new().routes(routes![create_user, users::list])
```

expands to

```rust
::std::vec![__siderite_route_create_user(), users::__siderite_route_list()]
```

Only the last path segment is rewritten (a leading `::` is kept); generic
arguments are rejected. `routes![]` is an empty `Vec`; a trailing comma is
fine. Because the generated function is separate from the handler, refer to
handlers by a path where they are defined (`users::list`), not through a
`use users::list;` re-import of the handler alone.

## Handlers, extractors and responses

A handler is an `async fn` with zero or more arguments returning something
that implements `IntoResponse`. Every argument except the last implements
`FromRequestParts`; the **last** argument may implement `FromRequest` and thus
consume the request body (`Json<T>`, `Form<T>`, raw bodies). Built-in
extractors: `Path<T>`, `Query<T>`, `Json<T>`, `State<T>`, `Depends<T>`,
`HttpBearer` and the other security schemes (see [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md)),
... All traits are siderite's own; no axum types leak into the public API.

Custom extractors and responses document themselves through the optional
`describe` hook, which receives the `Operation` being built and the
`SchemaRegistry`:

```rust
struct ApiKey;

impl FromRequestParts for ApiKey {
    async fn from_request_parts(parts: &mut Parts) -> Result<Self, ApiError> { /* .. */ }

    fn describe(op: &mut Operation, r: &mut SchemaRegistry) {
        op.add_parameter(Parameter::new(
            "x-api-key", ParameterLocation::Header, true, r.subschema::<String>(),
        ));
    }
}
```

`IntoResponse::describe` works the same way (e.g. `op.add_response(..)`).
The default `describe` documents nothing, so an undocumented extractor
still works.

Types used in bodies, queries and responses derive `Schema` (see below);
nested types are always obtained through `registry.subschema::<T>()`, so named
types become `components.schemas` entries referenced by `$ref`.

## Mounting and OpenAPI merge

`App::mount(prefix, app)` (alias `nest`) serves `app` below `prefix`. For
OpenAPI, the child's operations are added to the parent's document under the
prefixed path (`/` maps to the prefix itself); component schemas from all
apps share one registry, so a type used in several places is emitted once.
Two different Rust types claiming the same schema name, duplicate operation
ids, and duplicate `(path, method)` pairs are configuration errors reported
when the app is built (`TestClient::try_new`, `run`) or by `App::openapi()`.
Startup/shutdown hooks of mounted apps are lifted to the root; title, version
and docs settings come from the root app only. State registered with
`with_state` applies to the routes of the app it was called on.

## `#[derive(Schema)]`

Generates `Schema` for structs and enums, honouring the common serde
attributes (`rename`, `rename_all`, `skip*`, `default`, `deny_unknown_fields`,
`tag`/`content`/`untagged`) plus `#[field(..)]` constraints (`min_length`,
`max_length`, `pattern`/`regex`, `gt`, `ge`, `lt`, `le`, `multiple_of`,
`email`, `url`, `title`, `description`, `examples(..)`, `alias`). Unknown
`#[field]` keys are ignored so other derives can share the attribute. Doc
comments become descriptions. Constraints added to a `$ref` property wrap it as
`{"allOf": [{"$ref": ..}], ...}`.

* Non-generic types are named after the type; generic types are inline unless
  `#[schema(name = "..")]`; `#[schema(inline)]` always inlines.
* `flatten`, `transparent`, `from`/`into`/`try_from`, `remote`, `with` and
  `serialize_with`/`deserialize_with`, split `rename(serialize = ..)` forms,
  `other`, variant-level `untagged`, and tuple variants of internally tagged
  enums are rejected with a compile error rather than described wrongly.
* Internally tagged newtype variants are described as
  `allOf [tag object, inner]`, which assumes the inner type serializes as an
  object (as serde requires).

## Differences from FastAPI

* Routes are values; decorators only generate a sibling function, so nothing
  is registered at import time and handlers stay plain callable functions.
* Request validation is driven by types (`Json<T>`, `Query<T>`), not by
  default-argument markers. `#[field(..)]` constraints feed both the OpenAPI
  schema and `#[derive(Validate)]`.
* Dependency injection is explicit: `Depends<T>`, `Provided<T>` and `State<T>`
  (see [DEPENDENCY_INJECTION.md](DEPENDENCY_INJECTION.md)).
* `status` is per operation and replaces only a `200`, so handlers can still
  return specific statuses themselves.
* Routers are `App`s (`mount`) rather than a separate `APIRouter` type.
